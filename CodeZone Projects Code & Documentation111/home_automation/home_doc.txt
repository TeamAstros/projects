Setup:

Components are connected to the Arduino board: HC-05 Bluetooth module for communication, relays for controlling appliances, and output devices (light, fan, etc.).

The Arduino reads input commands sent via Bluetooth and processes them.

Relays are used as electronic switches to turn appliances on or off based on the received commands.

Bluetooth Communication:

HC-05 Bluetooth module operates as a serial communication device, receiving commands like 'a', 'b', etc., from the controlling device.

Command Processing:

Arduino processes the received commands to perform specific tasks:

'a': Turns on the main light.

'b': Turns off the main light.

'c': Turns on the fan.

'd': Turns off the fan.

'e': Turns on the small lamp.

'f': Turns off the small lamp.

Relay Control:

The relays act as switches to control appliances. When the Arduino sends a HIGH signal, the relay completes the circuit to turn on the device, and a LOW signal turns it off.

Hardware Components
Arduino Uno:

A microcontroller board that processes input commands and controls the relays.

HC-05 Bluetooth Module:

Used for wireless serial communication between the user device and Arduino.

Relay Modules:

Acts as a switch to control high-voltage appliances. The relays used here are connected to the GPIO pins of Arduino.

Power Supply:

Ensures the system is powered; the Arduino and relays require separate power supplies.

Appliances:

Devices like lights, fans, or small lamps connected via relays.

Wires and Breadboard:

For circuit connections and prototyping.

Code Explanation and Snippets
1. Bluetooth Initialization
cpp
// Define Bluetooth RX and TX Pins
SoftwareSerial BT(2, 3);  // Assign pins for Bluetooth communication
BT.begin(9600);           // Start Bluetooth communication at 9600 baud rate
HC-05 communicates through these pins (2 for RX, 3 for TX) and enables the Arduino to interact wirelessly.

2. Relay Setup
cpp
const int light_relay = 5;
const int fan_relay = 6;
const int smallLight_relay = 7;

void setup() {
  pinMode(light_relay, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(fan_relay, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(smallLight_relay, OUTPUT);
}
Sets relay pins as output to control appliances.

3. Command Processing
cpp
if (BT.available()) {
  char Command = BT.read(); // Read command from Bluetooth
  Serial.println(Command);  // Print command for debugging
}
Checks if data is received via Bluetooth, reads the character, and prints it to the Serial Monitor.

4. Relay Control
cpp
if (Command == 'a') digitalWrite(light_relay, 1); // Turn on main light
else if (Command == 'b') digitalWrite(light_relay, 0); // Turn off main light
else if (Command == 'c') digitalWrite(fan_relay, 1); // Turn on fan
else if (Command == 'd') digitalWrite(fan_relay, 0); // Turn off fan
else if (Command == 'e') digitalWrite(smallLight_relay, 1); // Turn on small lamp
else if (Command == 'f') digitalWrite(smallLight_relay, 0); // Turn off small lamp
Based on the received command, the respective relay is activated or deactivated.
